repa
====

Repa provides high performance, regular, multi-dimensional, shape polymorphic parallel arrays. 
All numeric data is stored unboxed. Functions written with the Repa combinators are automatically
parallel provided you supply +RTS -Nwhatever on the command line when running the program.

* Home page and bug tracker are on a [separate site](http://repa.ouroborus.net/).

* PULL REQUESTS: If you want your pull request merged then send email to benl <wibble> ouroborus.net. I am brutal about ignoring notifications from web things like github, but am happy to receive emails directly from people.
